Hey Communications Chair!

Below is an outline of some key things regarding the upkeep and maintenance of the PBoard website. Hope you find it helpful, and you are more than welcome to reach out to me with any questions you may have.

Best,
Jason Brillon

1) What You're Editing:
	You're really only going to be editing the HTML files. Those are all the ones that are in the home directory, entitled <nameofpage>.html. There are other files (css and js) that are within other subfolders, but they control the styling, not the content. Don't worry about those.
2) Where to Edit It:
	In all of the HTML files, I created commented sections that say "FOR COMM CHAIR"… Feel free to ctrl-find those in order to see where you should be editing.
3) How to Edit It (Text):
	You'll be changing either the text or the photos on these webpages. So, don't worry about the confusing letters/words like "h1" or "p" inside the open and closing tags (basically ignore the anything between a greater-than symbol and a less-than symbol; just pay attention to the words between those symbols – the actual words that appear on the website).
	To change the text, just erase the parts of the text that you don't want. It's no different than Microsoft Word or any other text-editor; just make sure that you DO NOT touch/erase those tags I just talked about.
4) How to Edit It (Line Breaks):
	If you ever want to add a line-break, just write </br> in the area in which you want to insert a line-break. That inserts a line break between what is before it and what is after it. You can do multiple </br>'s if you want extra line-breaks. Pressing "enter" will not work to get a line-break.
5) How to Edit It (Images):
	If you want to edit a person (i.e. cochairs) image on a page, read the code below/near the comment for that given section of the HTML page. Everyone is paired with an image file that has their name in it. For example, <img src="images/jason.png"/>. If you want to change the image, just change the name to someone else… so maybe it'd go from 'jason' to 'josh'.
	However, you have to actually have an image in your images folder called 'josh.png'. So save and add an image in there of Josh (or whoever) and call it by the desired name.
	You should make sure it has the same dimensions/sizes as all the other headshots of people in the images folder. It's a perfect square, with 328px by 328px. If that's too confusing to understand, maybe paste the desired image onto a COPY of another image in the images folder. And then just scale it down until it fits on top of the other one. Being able to do this part might be confusing, but that being said it has absolutely nothing to do with computer science.
6) How to Edit It (Colors, animations, and fancier things):
	I'd recommend asking someone who has even the most basic understanding of computer science how to do something more intricate, like any of these things. They would have to go into the CSS or JS folder and actually do some basic coding.
